# When you provide something to someone, whether it's a tool, information, or resources, you're essentially offering them the means to act or create. However, the responsibility for what they do with those resources ultimately lies with them, not with you.

Here's why:

1. **Autonomy**: Each individual has their own autonomy and agency. They have the freedom to make choices and decisions based on their own values, beliefs, and circumstances. You can offer guidance or support, but you can't control how they choose to utilize what you provide.

2. **Intent vs. Action**: Your intention in providing something may be entirely benign or even helpful, but the recipient may choose to use it in a harmful or negative way. Intentions don't always align with actions, and you can't be held accountable for someone else's actions that deviate from your original intent.

3. **Individual Accountability**: Everyone is responsible for their own actions. Just because you provide someone with something doesn't mean you're responsible for how they use it. Each person bears the consequences, whether positive or negative, of their choices and behaviors.

4. **Limitation of Control**: You can't control other people's thoughts, feelings, or actions. Even if you provide guidance or instructions along with what you offer, individuals may interpret and apply them differently based on their own perspectives and experiences.

5. **Complexity of Influence**: People are influenced by a multitude of factors beyond what you provide them. Their upbringing, education, peer influences, personal experiences, and various other factors all play a role in shaping their decisions and behaviors. Your contribution is just one piece of a much larger puzzle.
